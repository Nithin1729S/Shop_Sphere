The thing is I have made two websites one has only the frontend and the other is an attempt to make a website with backend.

This is the website with backend. I made this following this tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxMB6Njs3ck

I have uploaded the website with just frontend in another repo.

This website uses Django and it uses Sqlite as database.



To run the website

1) Create a virtual environment

virualenv env

source env/bin/activate

2) Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

3) Run the server

python manage.py makemigrations

python manage.py migrate

python manage.py runserver
